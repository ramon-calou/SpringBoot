# SpringBoot - POC

It's an POC project using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, AJAX Request's and JPQL Queries.

In this project,  i implemented a reverse ajax using DWR(Direct Web Remoting), which is a Java library that allows server to send and Ajax requests to the client side.

I'll leave the DWR documentation link below for those who are interested.
